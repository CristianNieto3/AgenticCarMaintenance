This project is a Car Maintenance Tracker that helps car owners log and monitor service history for their vehicles.

Users can register one or more vehicles and record maintenance events such as oil changes, tire rotations, and brake service.

Each maintenance record stores date, mileage, service type, cost, and optional notes.

The system allows users to view a complete maintenance history for each vehicle.

The application can suggest upcoming services based on mileage or time since the last service.

An LLM-powered assistant helps interpret user requests (e.g., “log an oil change for my Challenger at 72,000 miles”).

The system supports editing and deleting existing maintenance records when corrections are needed.

Users can quickly see overdue or upcoming services through simple console or web-based interactions.

The back-end logic and UML artifacts (use case diagram, class diagram, sequence diagrams) are generated using agentic AI.

The final application demonstrates how LLM agents can assist in software design and code generation for a realistic, everyday use case.
